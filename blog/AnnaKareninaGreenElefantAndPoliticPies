Green Elefant:
Disgusting movie;
Completly disregards human dignity.
Movie is probably illegal and rightfully so.
Nevertheless captivating and not terrible. It feels wrong to call it a good movie, but it actually might be.
It is very understandable how it became cult classic among certain image boards. 
There is no moral to the story, which is fine. I do not understand how the actors agreed to play such dehumanizing roles. Their performence is really good. Yet the movie is so disgusting, that anyone who does associate himself with it, likely wants to be perceived as a psychopath, or is one.
Including the producer and the actors. I do not associate myself with the movie, but it did make an impression on me, enough dedicate these couple sentences. I do not associate myself with the movie, but it did make an impression on me, enough dedicate these couple sentences. 

The first half of the movie mainly portrays to soldiers in captivity. One of the soldiers is kontschneniy. As a viewer, he is unbearable and we emphasize with the rage and hatered of the other soldier.

If the movie was taken in Germany, the moral would be, that there is no human dignity. The movie was not filmed in Germany, and the concept of dignity, never arrived to that place.

Works that I am reminded of are a clockwork orange, and Kafkas Metamorphosis. 

The movies second half is weaker than its first. 
I have no words to express my disgust.
